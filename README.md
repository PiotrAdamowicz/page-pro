# PagePro recruitment task

With reference to: [https://github.com/Pagepro/frontend-recruitment-task-dashboard]()

## Must-have

### Biggest difficulties:

2. First time I've used Sass with BEM (don't know why it's awesome)

3. Unfortunately I did not find any breakpoints. I'm not sure if it was due to my lack of knowledge about Adobe or for some other reason.Despite that I've tried to make it scale.

6. This was my biggest problem. I had no previous in-depth experience with styling form elements in React

## Good to have:

1. Unfortunately, I did not make it on time.

1. I had difficulties with that. Couldn't find/install dependencies so I bootstrapper project with create react app.

1. A lot f refactoring, I've used mainly flex few times grid layout.

1. I've used mainly Sass variables no native CSS one's

1. Done. Not perfect but it really helped make styling structure more flat and easy to modify


## Browser support

I've used polyfils recomended on React website
